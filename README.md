# Godot-Sprite-Primitives
A collection of quick and easy to use sprite primitives for the Godot game engine.

Ever run into the annoying problem where you just want to block out a quick 2D level?
Don't worry anymore! I got your back with some juicy quick nodes.

Just include the addon and enable it, then you should see the various available
primitive types in the node creation menu!

Custom Node Types:
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle
- Polygon
- Line
- Multiline (Interconnected Eg. 3 points will draw two lines connected at the second point.)

All the primitives use the CanvasItem draw calls and allow for disabling constant draw calls during editor or play.
